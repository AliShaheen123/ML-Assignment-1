You can find a detailed report as report.pdf. 

The provided notebook (.ipynb file) includes all of the source code. Run it cell by cell. It require python version of 3.6.9 (the official version for google colab) or more.

\* Please note that the notebook might crush in cases you run all cells since it require a lot of computations. To solve that just run the heavy code cells (which include training model or PCA) one by one. 

This repo was done as part of the machine learning course at Innopolis University. Please take a look at the main report for better explanations.
